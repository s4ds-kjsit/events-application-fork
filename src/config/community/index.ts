/**
 * The group people are asked to join after registering, keyed by `Event.slug`.
 *
 * Same reasoning as the form, speaker and problem-statement registries: content
 * that changes once per event, easier to review in a diff than in a table.
 *
 * This is where day-of updates actually reach people. Email gets read once;
 * "the hall moved to 402" needs a channel people already have open, and we
 * can't send SMS. So the ask goes on the ticket page AND in the confirmation
 * email rather than in one of the two.
 *
 * A WhatsApp invite link is a **capability**: anyone holding it can join the
 * group. It's on the ticket page, which is only reachable with a registration
 * code, and in the registrant's own email — but treat it as semi-public and
 * reset the link from WhatsApp if it spreads further than you want.
