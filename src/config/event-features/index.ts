/**
 * What each event does and doesn't do, keyed by `Event.slug`.
 *
 * These started as one-line Sets in three separate files — a schedule list, an
 * email list, and nearly a ticket list. All keyed by the same slug, all
 * answering the same question. That shape drifts: someone adds an event to two
 * of the three, and the one they missed is silent rather than wrong, which is
 * the hardest kind of bug to notice. One record per event makes an omission
 * visible at a glance.
 *
 * These are CODE, not columns, for the same reason the form and speaker
 * registries are: they change once per event and are easier to review in a diff
 * than in a table. The database still holds everything that varies per
 * registration.
