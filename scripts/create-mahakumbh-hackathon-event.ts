/**
 * Creates (or updates) the Mahakumbh Hackathon event.
 *
 * Selected teams work with the Government of Maharashtra on the Nashik Kumbh
 * Mela (Aug-Sep 2027). Twelve problem statements from the WRC/ICSSR call,
 * three teams shortlisted per statement, two members per team.
 *
 * This event sends NO EMAIL at any stage and issues no certificates. The
 * no-email block is a slug in src/config/email-policy, not a flag on the row —
 * see that file for what it costs (no ticket resend, no paper trail). The
 * WhatsApp group in src/config/community is the channel that replaces it, and
 * the ticket page is where people are asked to join.
 *
 * Safe to re-run - it upserts on slug rather than wiping, unlike `db:seed`.
 * Unlike create-ai-agents-event.ts this does NOT touch admin_users; use
 * scripts/create-admin.ts if you need a login.
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/create-mahakumbh-hackathon-event.ts
